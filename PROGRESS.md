# Retrospeq build ledger

Single source of truth for "what's done, what's next, what's blocked."
Every agent (coder, tester, security-reviewer, qa, orchestrator) reads
this before starting and updates it before finishing. This is the only
continuity mechanism across context resets and scheduled-restart gaps
— treat a stale or missing update as a bug in the run, not a formality.

## Autonomy policy

Owner-approved 2026-08-19: agents may commit and push to `main` and
deploy to production with no human review gate. This does not waive
the mandatory quality gates in AGENTS.md ("Security bar", "Testing
bar") — those are the spec's own definition of done, not a
discussion-avoidance layer. A module is not "complete" in this ledger
until its security tests and RLS coverage pass, regardless of push
authority.

## Phase status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Golden fixture library + shadow harness | Fixture library built (8/8, `fixtures/golden/`); shadow harness infrastructure built (`shadow_runs` migration + `lib/analytics/shadow-harness/`) and unit/property tested — see "Current task" for the precise scope boundary (harness infra only; no real shadow analytics registered yet, RLS unverified against a live DB) |
| 1 | Module 01 (Identity & Accounts) + Module 02 (Trade Ingestion & Model) | Not started |
| 2 | Module 04 (Rulebook & Evaluation) + Module 08 onboarding | Not started |
| 3 | Module 03 (Field Registry & Strategy) + Module 05 (Analytics & Findings) | Not started |
| 4 | Module 06 (Review & Graduation) + Module 07 (Engagement) | Not started |
| v1.1 | Module 09 (Prop firm rulebooks) + Module 10 (AI layer) | Deferred |

## Current task

Phase 0 golden fixture library complete: 8/8 fixtures under
`fixtures/golden/` (`simple_daytrades`, `scaled_in_out`,
`swing_with_intraday`, `flip_no_flat`, `partial_fills_subsecond`,
`overnight_weekend`, `multi_currency`, `gapped_history`), each with
`input.json` / `expected.json` / `README.md`, plus `fixtures/README.md`
(library overview) and `docs/adr/0001-flip-fill-split-via-trade-events.md`
(the `trade_fills` unique-index vs. §4.2 "split fill" resolution used in
`flip_no_flat`). All expected values verified by an independent script
cross-check (pnl, outcome, `server_day`, `hold_seconds`, `risk_pct` /
`initial_risk_pct` / `r_multiple`, `scale_out_count`) before commit — not
just hand-computed once. `npm run build` passes.

**Shadow harness built (2026-08-19), scoped deliberately:**

Built — Module 05 §3.1/§4.9, the harness's own data model and
infrastructure:

- `supabase/migrations/20260819020000_shadow_harness.sql` — `shadow_runs`
  table exactly per spec, RLS owner policy (00-foundation §3.1 default —
  no exception documented for this table), plus a `uuid_generate_v7()`
  function definition (no module spec defines one anywhere, despite every
  DDL block referencing it; this is the first migration in the repo that
  needs it, so it owns the canonical definition — see the file's header
  comment for the RFC 9562 bit-layout reasoning).
- `lib/analytics/shadow-harness/` — `types.ts` (the `ShadowAnalytic<TFact>`
  contract), `runner.ts` (`runShadowAnalytic`/`runShadowAnalyticBatch` —
  pure, never fabricates a result on a thrown compute error), `repository.ts`
  (Supabase-backed persistence that throws `ShadowHarnessNotConfiguredError`
  naming the missing env vars — no live Supabase project exists, so this
  fails loudly rather than no-op'ing), `promotion.ts` (mechanically checks
  the "ran without error on ≥ 30 accounts" half of the shadow→beta
  criteria; the other two criteria are explicitly represented as
  `'not_automatable'`, never guessed), `eligible-trade.ts` (Module 05
  §4.1's population filter, restated as a pure predicate — not an engine).
- Tests: 27 passing (vitest + fast-check property tests on the runner's
  faithfulness and the promotion helper's distinct-account counting),
  4 RLS assertions left as explicit `describe.skip`/`it.todo` (cannot run
  without a live Postgres — see below). Coverage on the harness code:
  98.3% lines / 96.7% branches (`npm run test:coverage`).
- `docs/runbook.md` created — one entry, "Shadow analytic diverging from
  expectation" (00-foundation §7.3's alerting row for this piece).

**Deliberately NOT built** (scope boundary — see decision log below for
the full reasoning): the edge engine, the detection engine, the
statistical gates (§4.3), and the `spec.weekday` canary (§4.10) itself.
All of them need confirmed trades from Module 02, which doesn't exist in
this repo yet (no grouping engine — only its golden fixtures). The harness
is generic infrastructure, tested with synthetic stand-in analytics
(`__tests__/fixtures.ts`), not a fake grouping engine. It is ready to
accept real registrations the moment Module 02 lands.

**Not verified — flagged, not faked:** RLS on `shadow_runs` is written
per spec but has never run against a live Postgres (no Supabase project
for Retrospeq — see "Infra gaps"). The migration also has a forward
dependency on Module 01's `profiles` table, which doesn't exist yet
either, so this migration file cannot literally be applied to any
database as-is right now; it is correct against the eventual schema, not
against a schema that exists today.

Next: Phase 1, Module 01 (Identity & Accounts) + Module 02 (Trade
Ingestion & Model), per brief-developer-and-design.md build order. Real
shadow-analytic registrations (starting with `spec.weekday`) become
buildable once Module 02's confirmed trades and Module 05's edge-engine
gates exist — not a Phase 0 task, tracked for whenever Module 05's
engines themselves get built (Phase 3 per the build order).

## Needs-your-input signal

See `NEEDS_YOUR_INPUT.md` at the repo root — that file, not this
section, is the fast glanceable answer to "does anything need the
owner right now." This "Infra gaps" list below is the standing,
known-future-needs reference; `NEEDS_YOUR_INPUT.md` is only for things
actually stalling current work. See AGENTS.md → "When something needs
the owner — never fake it, always flag it."

## Infra gaps (tracked, not blocking on code)

- [ ] No Vercel project for Retrospeq. Owner needs to create one and either connect this repo via Vercel's GitHub integration or supply a deploy token.
- [x] ~~No Supabase project for Retrospeq~~ — **dev/test only, as of 2026-08-20.** Sharing the existing LuceEdge project (`vbuzudbipftgsuosreuy`), isolated via a dedicated `retrospeq` Postgres schema — see `docs/adr/0002-shared-dev-supabase-project.md`. `.env.local` has the URL + keys. **Still open, not closed by this:** a dedicated paid-tier project is required before real launch (00-foundation §1.1) — this only unblocks local RLS/migration verification.
- [ ] No external KMS account (AWS KMS / GCP KMS / equivalent) for the envelope-encryption master key. Cannot be created by an agent — needs owner action.
- [ ] No git remote for this repo. Parent repo's remote (`origin` → `lucedge_v1.git`) is a different product; do not push this project there. Owner needs to create a new GitHub repo and add it as `origin` here.
- [ ] Broker integration vendor undecided (00-foundation §10). Build against `BrokerAdapter` only; do not let a vendor type leak past the adapter.
- [ ] Node version is 20.11.0; several deps warn they want >=22 (`@supabase/*@2.112.3`, `eslint-visitor-keys@5`). Still warn-only for those. **One hard incompatibility already hit and fixed**: vitest 4.x pulls in a rolldown-based Vite that requires `node:util`'s `styleText` (Node ≥20.12) — pinned `vitest`/`@vitest/coverage-v8` to `3.2.7` instead (classic esbuild-based Vite, no rolldown), see decision log. Revisit the pin when Node is upgraded past 20.11.

## Decision log

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — decision — why — spec/section it reconciles`

- 2026-08-20 — Adopted the existing LuceEdge Supabase project for Retrospeq dev/test use (owner offer), isolated via a dedicated `retrospeq` Postgres schema rather than `public` — a real `public.data_requests` name collision with LuceEdge's own table made schema separation necessary, not just cautious. Full reasoning in `docs/adr/0002-shared-dev-supabase-project.md`. The shadow-harness migration and its repository code were updated to be schema-qualified (`retrospeq.shadow_runs`, `db: { schema: 'retrospeq' }`); all 27 existing tests still pass. This does not close the standing need for a dedicated production Supabase project (00-foundation §1.1) — see reworded Infra gaps entry.

- 2026-08-19 — New Next.js app scaffolded at `E:\LuceEdge\retrospeq-app` as its own git repo, separate from the existing `E:\LuceEdge` LuceEdge codebase — Retrospeq is a distinct product per its own spec (Strategy/Rulebook/Field-registry architecture), not a reskin of LuceEdge's trade-journal spec. Owner-confirmed.
- 2026-08-19 — Existing LuceEdge auth/broker code is not being copied wholesale. Auth pattern (Supabase Auth, RLS-owner-policy, `data_requests` erasure flow) is reusable groundwork; broker integration (cTrader OAuth + MT5/Wine bridge) needs to be rebuilt behind a `BrokerAdapter` interface with real envelope encryption (KMS-wrapped per-credential keys) and the mandatory benign-trade-operation read-only verification, none of which the old code has.
- 2026-08-19 — npm cache/tmp redirected to `E:/npm-cache` and `E:/npm-tmp` because the C: drive is at 0 bytes free. Do not revert this without confirming C: has space again — installs will fail with ENOSPC otherwise.
- 2026-08-19 — Considered expanding the agent roster to a 17-role pipeline (separate Requirements/Architecture/Frontend/Backend/Database/Integration/Code-Review/Performance/Bug-Fix/Documentation agents). Rejected: kept the 5-agent roster (orchestrator/coder/tester/security-reviewer/qa) and instead folded the real gaps into existing agents — a repo-reuse-check step in `retrospeq-coder`, a documentation checklist (ADRs + runbook, per 00-foundation §12) and a performance-budget checklist (00-foundation §8.1) in `retrospeq-qa`, and pointing the orchestrator at the built-in `/code-review`/`simplify` skills instead of a bespoke review agent. Owner-confirmed: optimize for bug-free/scalable outcomes over role-count, keep documentation non-optional. Full reasoning in `C:\Users\hp\.claude\plans\orchestrator-agent-requirements-agent-cheerful-pizza.md`.
- 2026-08-19 — Built the Phase 0 golden fixture library (8 fixtures, `fixtures/golden/`) per 00-foundation §9.3 / Module 02 §7.1. Fixtures-only per this task's scope — the Module 05 shadow harness and the grouping engine remain unbuilt; see "Current task" above. Repo-checked first: nothing under `fixtures/` or `docs/adr/` existed from any prior partial run. Modeling decisions made explicit in `fixtures/README.md` (not repeated here in full): `input.json` mirrors `BrokerAdapter.fetchHistory` output plus minimal account context, excluding write-time-only fields (`id`, `server_day`, `imported_at`) per Module 02 §2.1/§2.2/§3.1; `expected.json` uses stable symbolic refs (`block_ref`/`trade_ref`) instead of literal UUIDs since UUIDv7 is insertion-time-derived and non-deterministic; `contract_value = 1` money-math simplification (no lot/contract-size table, out of scope per Module 02 §10); `server_day` arithmetic stated explicitly as `date(filled_at)` for `00:00:00 UTC` rollover and `date(filled_at − 22h) + 1 day` for `22:00:00 UTC` rollover (00-foundation states the policy, not the arithmetic); `scale_out_count = count(trade_fills.role in ('trim','exit'))`, reproducing Module 02 §7.1's only worked example; `trades.server_day = server_day(opened_at)`, fixed at open (blocks table says this explicitly, trades table doesn't but consistency is the obvious read — demonstrated directly in `overnight_weekend` and `swing_with_intraday`). Every expected value (pnl, outcome, `server_day`, `hold_seconds`, `risk_pct`/`initial_risk_pct`/`r_multiple`, `scale_out_count`) was cross-checked by an independent verification script against the formulas in Module 02 §4.4 before commit, not just hand-computed once.
- 2026-08-19 — Resolved a genuine spec tension found while building `flip_no_flat`: Module 02 §4.2 says a zero-crossing fill is "split across both blocks proportionally," but §3.1's `trade_fills_fill_unique` index requires every fill map to exactly one trade — both can't be literally true of one physical fill. Resolution: the physical fill gets exactly one `trade_fills` row (on the closing trade, `role = 'exit'`); the opening trade gets a `trade_events` row of `kind = 'entry'` referencing the same `fill_id` with the split volume (`trade_events` has no fill-uniqueness constraint). Full reasoning, rejected alternatives, and consequences (including a documented gotcha for the eventual grouping-engine implementation: the "expandable fill list" must union `trade_fills` + `trade_events` for flip-originated trades) recorded in `docs/adr/0001-flip-fill-split-via-trade-events.md`, per AGENTS.md's "Documentation" section (deliberate deviation from a 00-foundation convention → ADR, not just a decision-log line).
- 2026-08-19 — Built the Module 05 shadow harness (see "Current task" above), scoped to the harness's own infrastructure only. **Scope boundary decision:** Module 05 §3.1 defines `shadow_runs` alongside `findings`/`detections`/`analytic_renders`/`finding_rule_links` in one code block, but the latter four belong to the edge engine and detection engine (§4.2/§4.4), which read confirmed trades from Module 02 — a module that doesn't exist in this repo (no grouping engine, no `trades` table; only the golden fixtures modeling its eventual output exist). Built only `shadow_runs` plus a generic `ShadowAnalytic<TFact>` runner/promotion-eligibility layer that is deliberately agnostic to *how* an analytic computes `would_render`/`gate_failures` — that's the analytic's own gating logic (statistical gates, detection gates, or a bespoke check), not the harness's job. Did **not** implement the statistical gates (§4.3), the edge engine, the detection engine, or the `spec.weekday` canary (§4.10) itself — all of them need real confirmed trades to be meaningful, and building them against nothing would mean inventing a fake grouping engine, which AGENTS.md explicitly forbids ("without inventing a fake grouping engine to unblock yourself"). The harness is tested with synthetic stand-in analytics (`lib/analytics/shadow-harness/__tests__/fixtures.ts`) instead — the same way a job-queue library is tested with dummy jobs, not real ones. `eligible-trade.ts` is the one exception: Module 05 §4.1's population filter (`status='confirmed' AND not_a_decision=false AND closed_at is not null`) is fully specified in prose over fields Module 02's spec already documents exactly, so encoding it as a pure predicate (not an engine) is safe and directly useful once real trades exist. Real shadow-analytic registrations, starting with `spec.weekday`, wait on Module 02 (Phase 1) and Module 05's own edge engine (Phase 3).
- 2026-08-19 — `shadow_runs` RLS uses 00-foundation §3.1's default owner-policy shape (`user_id = auth.uid()`, full access) rather than a service-role-only exception. Module 05 doesn't list `shadow_runs` in any RLS-exception table the way Module 01 §3.3 does for `account_credentials`/`analytic_config`, so the default applies as written; "never rendered" is a product/UI property (Module 05 §4.9), not a database-access restriction, and nothing in the spec asks for the latter. Noted in the migration as reconsiderable via a future ADR if "shadow" is later decided to mean invisible-even-via-API rather than just invisible-in-the-UI.
- 2026-08-19 — `uuid_generate_v7()` is referenced in every module's DDL (00-foundation §2.1) but never defined anywhere in the design system. Defined it in the shadow harness migration (the first migration in this repo that needs it) as a plpgsql function following RFC 9562 §5.7's UUIDv7 byte layout, using `create or replace` so a later Module 01/02 migration that also declares it is a no-op rather than a conflict. Not a foundation deviation — an implementation of an assumed-to-exist primitive — so documented inline in the migration rather than as a separate ADR, per AGENTS.md "non-obvious migration constraints get an inline comment, not a separate doc."
- 2026-08-19 — Hit a real hard incompatibility while wiring up this repo's first tests: `vitest@4.1.11` (already a devDependency from initial scaffolding) pulls in a rolldown-based Vite whose startup requires `node:util`'s `styleText` export, added in Node 20.12 — this repo runs Node 20.11.0 (see "Infra gaps"). This is exactly the "hard incompatibility" the existing infra-gap line said to revisit on. Fix: pinned `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` to `3.2.7` (last major before the rolldown-based Vite chain; depends on `vite@^5||^6||^7`, all classic esbuild-based). Chose a devDependency downgrade over a Node upgrade because the Node install is machine-wide and shared with unrelated projects (the parent `E:\LuceEdge` repo, `Pesa Hi Pesa`) — changing it is a bigger, riskier action than pinning one package in this repo, and isn't necessary to unblock this task. All 27 shadow-harness tests pass under `vitest@3.2.7`; `npm run build` and `npm run lint` both still pass.

## Autonomous continuation

A scheduled routine re-invokes the orchestrator periodically so work
resumes after a context reset or usage-limit restart without a human
prompting it. See the routine created via the `schedule` skill /
CronCreate — check its config for current cadence. On each wake:
orchestrator reads this file, picks the next undone task in phase
order, dispatches coder/tester/security-reviewer/qa as needed, updates
this file, commits.
