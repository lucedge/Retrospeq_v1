# Retrospeq build ledger

Single source of truth for "what's done, what's next, what's blocked."
Every agent (coder, tester, security-reviewer, qa, orchestrator) reads
this before starting and updates it before finishing. This is the only
continuity mechanism across context resets and scheduled-restart gaps
— treat a stale or missing update as a bug in the run, not a formality.

## Autonomy policy

Owner-approved 2026-08-19: agents may commit and push to `main` and
deploy to production with no human review gate. This does not waive
the mandatory quality gates in AGENTS.md ("Security bar", "Testing
bar") — those are the spec's own definition of done, not a
discussion-avoidance layer. A module is not "complete" in this ledger
until its security tests and RLS coverage pass, regardless of push
authority.

## Phase status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Golden fixture library + shadow harness | Fixture library built (8/8, `fixtures/golden/`); shadow harness (Module 05) **not yet built** — do not treat Phase 0 as complete |
| 1 | Module 01 (Identity & Accounts) + Module 02 (Trade Ingestion & Model) | Not started |
| 2 | Module 04 (Rulebook & Evaluation) + Module 08 onboarding | Not started |
| 3 | Module 03 (Field Registry & Strategy) + Module 05 (Analytics & Findings) | Not started |
| 4 | Module 06 (Review & Graduation) + Module 07 (Engagement) | Not started |
| v1.1 | Module 09 (Prop firm rulebooks) + Module 10 (AI layer) | Deferred |

## Current task

Phase 0 golden fixture library complete: 8/8 fixtures under
`fixtures/golden/` (`simple_daytrades`, `scaled_in_out`,
`swing_with_intraday`, `flip_no_flat`, `partial_fills_subsecond`,
`overnight_weekend`, `multi_currency`, `gapped_history`), each with
`input.json` / `expected.json` / `README.md`, plus `fixtures/README.md`
(library overview) and `docs/adr/0001-flip-fill-split-via-trade-events.md`
(the `trade_fills` unique-index vs. §4.2 "split fill" resolution used in
`flip_no_flat`). All expected values verified by an independent script
cross-check (pnl, outcome, `server_day`, `hold_seconds`, `risk_pct` /
`initial_risk_pct` / `r_multiple`, `scale_out_count`) before commit — not
just hand-computed once. `npm run build` passes.

**Not done:** the Module 05 shadow harness that actually replays these
fixtures through a real grouping engine and diffs against `expected.json`
— there is no grouping engine yet to replay them through. Fixtures are
data-only right now (reviewable specification artifacts). Orchestrator:
next Phase 0 sub-task is the shadow harness once Module 02's grouping
engine exists (Phase 1), not before — building the harness against a
nonexistent engine would just be scaffolding with nothing to test.

Next after that: Phase 1, Module 01 (Identity & Accounts) + Module 02
(Trade Ingestion & Model), per brief-developer-and-design.md build order.

## Needs-your-input signal

See `NEEDS_YOUR_INPUT.md` at the repo root — that file, not this
section, is the fast glanceable answer to "does anything need the
owner right now." This "Infra gaps" list below is the standing,
known-future-needs reference; `NEEDS_YOUR_INPUT.md` is only for things
actually stalling current work. See AGENTS.md → "When something needs
the owner — never fake it, always flag it."

## Infra gaps (tracked, not blocking on code)

- [ ] No Vercel project for Retrospeq. Owner needs to create one and either connect this repo via Vercel's GitHub integration or supply a deploy token.
- [ ] No Supabase project for Retrospeq. Owner needs to create one on a **paid** tier — 00-foundation §1.1 states free tier pauses after ~7 days idle and has no PITR, both explicit launch blockers, not just a cost optimization.
- [ ] No external KMS account (AWS KMS / GCP KMS / equivalent) for the envelope-encryption master key. Cannot be created by an agent — needs owner action.
- [ ] No git remote for this repo. Parent repo's remote (`origin` → `lucedge_v1.git`) is a different product; do not push this project there. Owner needs to create a new GitHub repo and add it as `origin` here.
- [ ] Broker integration vendor undecided (00-foundation §10). Build against `BrokerAdapter` only; do not let a vendor type leak past the adapter.
- [ ] Node version is 20.11.0; several new deps warn they want >=22. Not yet a blocker, revisit if a hard incompatibility appears.

## Decision log

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — decision — why — spec/section it reconciles`

- 2026-08-19 — New Next.js app scaffolded at `E:\LuceEdge\retrospeq-app` as its own git repo, separate from the existing `E:\LuceEdge` LuceEdge codebase — Retrospeq is a distinct product per its own spec (Strategy/Rulebook/Field-registry architecture), not a reskin of LuceEdge's trade-journal spec. Owner-confirmed.
- 2026-08-19 — Existing LuceEdge auth/broker code is not being copied wholesale. Auth pattern (Supabase Auth, RLS-owner-policy, `data_requests` erasure flow) is reusable groundwork; broker integration (cTrader OAuth + MT5/Wine bridge) needs to be rebuilt behind a `BrokerAdapter` interface with real envelope encryption (KMS-wrapped per-credential keys) and the mandatory benign-trade-operation read-only verification, none of which the old code has.
- 2026-08-19 — npm cache/tmp redirected to `E:/npm-cache` and `E:/npm-tmp` because the C: drive is at 0 bytes free. Do not revert this without confirming C: has space again — installs will fail with ENOSPC otherwise.
- 2026-08-19 — Considered expanding the agent roster to a 17-role pipeline (separate Requirements/Architecture/Frontend/Backend/Database/Integration/Code-Review/Performance/Bug-Fix/Documentation agents). Rejected: kept the 5-agent roster (orchestrator/coder/tester/security-reviewer/qa) and instead folded the real gaps into existing agents — a repo-reuse-check step in `retrospeq-coder`, a documentation checklist (ADRs + runbook, per 00-foundation §12) and a performance-budget checklist (00-foundation §8.1) in `retrospeq-qa`, and pointing the orchestrator at the built-in `/code-review`/`simplify` skills instead of a bespoke review agent. Owner-confirmed: optimize for bug-free/scalable outcomes over role-count, keep documentation non-optional. Full reasoning in `C:\Users\hp\.claude\plans\orchestrator-agent-requirements-agent-cheerful-pizza.md`.
- 2026-08-19 — Built the Phase 0 golden fixture library (8 fixtures, `fixtures/golden/`) per 00-foundation §9.3 / Module 02 §7.1. Fixtures-only per this task's scope — the Module 05 shadow harness and the grouping engine remain unbuilt; see "Current task" above. Repo-checked first: nothing under `fixtures/` or `docs/adr/` existed from any prior partial run. Modeling decisions made explicit in `fixtures/README.md` (not repeated here in full): `input.json` mirrors `BrokerAdapter.fetchHistory` output plus minimal account context, excluding write-time-only fields (`id`, `server_day`, `imported_at`) per Module 02 §2.1/§2.2/§3.1; `expected.json` uses stable symbolic refs (`block_ref`/`trade_ref`) instead of literal UUIDs since UUIDv7 is insertion-time-derived and non-deterministic; `contract_value = 1` money-math simplification (no lot/contract-size table, out of scope per Module 02 §10); `server_day` arithmetic stated explicitly as `date(filled_at)` for `00:00:00 UTC` rollover and `date(filled_at − 22h) + 1 day` for `22:00:00 UTC` rollover (00-foundation states the policy, not the arithmetic); `scale_out_count = count(trade_fills.role in ('trim','exit'))`, reproducing Module 02 §7.1's only worked example; `trades.server_day = server_day(opened_at)`, fixed at open (blocks table says this explicitly, trades table doesn't but consistency is the obvious read — demonstrated directly in `overnight_weekend` and `swing_with_intraday`). Every expected value (pnl, outcome, `server_day`, `hold_seconds`, `risk_pct`/`initial_risk_pct`/`r_multiple`, `scale_out_count`) was cross-checked by an independent verification script against the formulas in Module 02 §4.4 before commit, not just hand-computed once.
- 2026-08-19 — Resolved a genuine spec tension found while building `flip_no_flat`: Module 02 §4.2 says a zero-crossing fill is "split across both blocks proportionally," but §3.1's `trade_fills_fill_unique` index requires every fill map to exactly one trade — both can't be literally true of one physical fill. Resolution: the physical fill gets exactly one `trade_fills` row (on the closing trade, `role = 'exit'`); the opening trade gets a `trade_events` row of `kind = 'entry'` referencing the same `fill_id` with the split volume (`trade_events` has no fill-uniqueness constraint). Full reasoning, rejected alternatives, and consequences (including a documented gotcha for the eventual grouping-engine implementation: the "expandable fill list" must union `trade_fills` + `trade_events` for flip-originated trades) recorded in `docs/adr/0001-flip-fill-split-via-trade-events.md`, per AGENTS.md's "Documentation" section (deliberate deviation from a 00-foundation convention → ADR, not just a decision-log line).

## Autonomous continuation

A scheduled routine re-invokes the orchestrator periodically so work
resumes after a context reset or usage-limit restart without a human
prompting it. See the routine created via the `schedule` skill /
CronCreate — check its config for current cadence. On each wake:
orchestrator reads this file, picks the next undone task in phase
order, dispatches coder/tester/security-reviewer/qa as needed, updates
this file, commits.
